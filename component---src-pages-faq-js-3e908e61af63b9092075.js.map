The front of the church is at the corners of East Market\n            St, Beech St and Regan St, just West of NC A&T. We enter through the\n            entrance at the parking lot off of Beech St.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>When are the Den Meetings and how long do they run?</strong>\n            <br />\n            Den meetings usually run on Mondays when school are open. From 7pm\n            until around 8pm. We ask that everyone arrive around 6:50pm so that\n            we can start on time (and leave on time).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>What kind of activities can I expect?</strong>\n            <br />\n            Leaders and parents arrange a variety of activities, and trips for\n            our scouts along with the offical cub scout activities. Den meetings\n            are design to have scouts participate in activites in pursuit of\n            badges and experience during each meeting.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>What is the cost to participate?</strong>\n            <br />\n            The cost of membership starts at $30 for the year (prorated\n            dependant on time of year). Scouts should also have a className A\n            uniform purchased from the council office. There are also various\n            activities and trips that may have additional cost as well. Our pack\n            does fundraisers and popcorn sales to offset the costs of activities\n            as much as possible.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Are parents required to attend the den meetings?</strong>\n            <br />\n            For Lions and Tigers, parents are required to stay for the full den\n            meeting. For Wolves and beyond parents do not have to stay at the\n            meeting but we strongly encourage full participation. The Scouting\n            experience is made much better for everyone when there is active\n            parent involvement. Scouting—especially Cub Scouting—is a family\n            focused enterprise.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default FAQ\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
